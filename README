This plugin extends the flexibility of printing from VIM using PSUtils - http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~ajcd/psutils/. The plugin supports:

o N-up printing,
o Manual duplex printing (feeding printed pages back into the printer to print the reverse sides)
o Reverse page order printing.
o Print to file.

There are also VIM functions to allow the Print Manager to be called from other scripts, as well as being hooked to the :hardcopy command using the printexpr option.

See included help file for details on setting up and using the Print Manager plugin.

NOTE: This replaces the dup_prt.zip Duplex Printing plugin - if you had previously installed this plugin then please remove this from your runtime directories.
